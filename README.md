## OVS front end application w/ rest api

### Dependencies
django-rest-framework

### Implementation
Using the data pull scripts, we will be pulling abstract information directly into the database. However, the rest api allows post requests directly into the database

Ideally, the front end framework will be implemented with ReactJS

Work in Progress.
